# IMDB-CLone_App


This project is a web application that utilizes the power of vanilla JavaScript. 
The app's main feature is its ability to search for movies using the Omdb API. 
The API returns various data related to the searched movie, such as movie title, year, and other important information. 
The app then displays this information in an easy-to-read format, allowing users to quickly find the movie details they want to watch.

In addition to the search feature, the app also includes the ability for users to view details of the selected movie. 
This includes a more in-depth look at the movie's details. 
Users can also mark their favorite movies for easy access in the future.
